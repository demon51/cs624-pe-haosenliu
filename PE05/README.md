# Input
The enhanced Cities App now includes two additional tabs: AddCountry and Countries. For the AddCountry feature, users can input two key pieces of data: the Country Name and its corresponding Currency. This information is entered through a user-friendly interface that prompts for each detail in separate input fields.

# Process
Upon receiving the user's input, the program's underlying logic processes the information. When a user submits a new country, the program validates the input and updates the internal data structure that stores the list of countries and their currencies. This includes appending the new country to the existing list in real-time, ensuring the application's state is immediately reflective of the changes.

# Output
The Countries tab provides a display of the current list of countries along with their specified currencies. This output is dynamically generated, with each new entry immediately visible in the list. The display is organized in a clear, easy-to-read format that allows users to quickly scan through the updated list of countries and their monetary units.
