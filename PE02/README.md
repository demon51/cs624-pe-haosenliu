### Input
The application receives two types of inputs from the user:

Direct interaction with the app through scrolling the course lists.
Text input where the user can specify their favorite course, using a TextInput component.
Additionally, the app reads an image (icon.png) from the ./assets directory to display on the screen.

### Process
Upon launching the app, the CoreComponentsApp functional component, created using an arrow function, renders the UI elements. The app utilizes core React Native components like ScrollView, Image, Text, and TextInput to display the content. The useState hook manages the state of the favorite course input. As the user inputs text, the state updates dynamically, storing the current value.

### Output
The app presents a scrollable screen, displaying an image followed by a question, a text input field, and lists of courses. The design, ensured by StyleSheet, enhances user experience with appropriate styling.
