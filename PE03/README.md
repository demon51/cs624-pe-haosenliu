### Input
The user interacts with the "todos" app where they can add new to-do items. To start, the contents of the previous "todos" app from HOS03 and HOS04 are copied to a new directory, PE03-todos. New tasks are input via a UI, and the user has the ability to filter tasks based on their completion status.

### Process
Part 1 builds upon HOS03. It introduces a button to add new to-dos to an array. Every time a new to-do is added, the item is also logged in the terminal, allowing for developer-side monitoring.

Part 2 extends HOS04. It enhances the app by adding a tab bar filter that enables users to view all to-dos, only completed ones, or solely incomplete tasks. This filtration process provides users with a streamlined view tailored to their preference.

For detailed steps on implementation and relevant code listings, users can refer to chapters in the provided textbook by Dabit (2019).

### Output
The app's UI presents to-dos in a list format. Users receive visual feedback upon adding tasks. With the filter feature, the displayed list adjusts according to the user's chosen filter criteria (all, completed, or incomplete tasks). Additionally, as tasks are added, corresponding logs appear in the terminal, aiding in tracking and debugging.
