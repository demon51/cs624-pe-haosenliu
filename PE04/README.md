# Input

The program begins by defining a set of data representing profiles, each containing an image, name, occupation, and description. This data is passed as props to the `ProfileCard` components. The `showThumbnail` state dictates the initial view of each profile card.

# Process

When the app is running, the `ProfileCard` component takes the input data and renders it according to the styles defined. If a card is in thumbnail mode (`showThumbnail` is `true`), it applies additional thumbnail styles that adjust the size of the text and image to fit a smaller card. The `handleProfileCardPress` function toggles the `showThumbnail` state, triggering a re-render of the affected card. The layout of the cards on the screen is managed using Flexbox properties set on the container, which aligns the cards in a responsive grid.

# Output

The output is a user interface consisting of profile cards displayed in a grid. Cards can be in a full-sized view or a thumbnail view, and users can interact with them. Pressing on a card toggles between these views, showcasing a responsive design that adapts to the state of the cards.
