### Input
The program begins by accepting user inputs, which could range from textual data to numerical values depending on the application's functionality. Inputs are designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, ensuring users can easily supply the data the program needs to operate effectively.

### Process
Upon receiving the input, the program processes it through a series of well-defined steps. This may involve calculations, data transformation, or algorithmic procedures that are central to the program's purpose. The processing phase is optimized for efficiency and accuracy, ensuring that the output is generated in a reliable and timely manner.

### Output
The result of the program's processing is then outputted in a user-readable format. The output is structured to provide clear and actionable information to the user, allowing them to make informed decisions or understand the results of the program's execution. Whether the output is presented as text on the screen, saved to a file, or transmitted over the network, it reflects the program's goal to deliver value from the user's input.
